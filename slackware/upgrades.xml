<description>
Point release 1.1 of the Breeze::OS GNU/Linux distribution which is based
on the Slackware 14.1 release. The Xfce, KDE, and Mate desktops are offered.
The Mate desktop is from the Salix repositories.

No ISO(s), for version 1.1, are currently available; because of the booting
problem mentioned in the news item number 4. We decided in the meantime
to try a Live-DVD and a netinstall release for April 2015.

First download the upgrade script and signature in the same folder.
   wget http://www.breezeos.com/distfiles/slackware/i486/1.1/brz-upgrade.sh
   wget http://www.breezeos.com/distfiles/slackware/i486/1.1/brz-upgrade.sh.asc

Then, invoke the script with the option '-slack' if you are upgrading from
a Slackware 14.0/14.1 distro; or without option, if you have our distro
installed on your computer.

<description>
This release is the &lt;b>last and long-term&lt;/b> point release for versions 1.x; and it
is still based on the Slackware 14.1 release, with the Xfce, KDE, and Mate
desktops being offered, It contains packages, i.e. &lt;i>OpenOffice 4.1.2&lt;/i>, which were
updated for either enhancements, bugs, or security issues; and, a new display
manager called &lt;b>brzdm&lt;/b> derived from &lt;b>Slim&lt;/b>. The source code for &lt;b>brzdm&lt;/b> will be hosted
at https://www.github.com. The default kernel is now Linux 4.1.17.

The main new features, which have been added to the package manager, are the
facility to &lt;b>websync&lt;/b> your installation with updated binary packages; as well as,
the capability to compile from source using &lt;i>slackbuilds&lt;/i>. An additional feature
was added to view &lt;b>security advisory&lt;/b> from &lt;b>Slackware&lt;/b>. Each package, by default,
has its checksum ang GnuPg signature verified; you, now, must turn verification off, when desired.

You can, now, just issue the command &lt;b>brzpkg --websync&lt;/b> to download and install
updated binary packages; &lt;b>brzpkg -A&lt;/b> to view security advisory news; and,
&lt;b>brzpkg -B &lt;pkg>&lt;/b> or &lt;b>brzpkg -I -b &lt;pkg>&lt;/b> to install a package from source.

Before proceeding, you &lt;b>must first update&lt;/b> the packager itself, by invoking
'brzpkg --update brzpkg'; then, invoke 'brzpkg --force --upgrade 1.2' to
proceed with the upgrade.
